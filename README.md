# Huffman Binary Tree
## Introduction
Huffman binary tree for coding english alphabet based on each letter statistical probabilty extrapolated from a text file with over 460k words.

## Wiki
>In computer science and information theory, a Huffman code is a particular type of optimal prefix code that is commonly used for lossless data compression. The process of finding or using such a code is Huffman coding.[^1]

## How it works
Currently each letter needs to be coded manually as shown is "Tree.png"
Huffman's alghorithm is tested in MATLab and proof of working properly is in "Proof of work"
